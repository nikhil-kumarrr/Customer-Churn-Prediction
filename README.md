# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by businesses today. It refers to customers who stop using a company’s service over time. Retaining customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, which makes churn prediction a vital part of business analytics.

This project aims to build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographic and service usage data. The model helps organizations take proactive actions — such as offering discounts, improving services, or personalizing communication — to retain valuable customers.

## Project Objectives

* Analyze customer data to understand the factors influencing churn.
* Build a predictive model to classify customers as churned or retained.
* Handle imbalanced datasets and improve model reliability.
* Provide actionable insights for business retention strategies.

## Technologies Used

*  Programming Language: Python
 ## Libraries & Tools:
   * NumPy, Pandas – for data manipulation
   * Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization
   * Scikit-learn – for ML algorithms and evaluation metrics
   * Jupyter Notebook – for experimentation and documentation

## Project Workflow : 

1. Data Collection & Understanding:
* Load the dataset and analyze features like customer demographics, services used, payment method, tenure, etc.

2. Data Preprocessing:
* Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualize churn distribution and identify key influencing factors.

4. Feature Engineering:
* Create meaningful features (e.g., monthly charges, contract type, tenure group).

5. Model Building:
*Train multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
*Handle data imbalance using SMOTE or Class Weighting.

6. Model Evaluation:
* Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
* Compare performance of different algorithms.

7. Insights & Recommendations:
* Identify major reasons for customer churn (e.g., short tenure, high monthly charges, contract type).

## Results

* Achieved strong model performance with high recall for churn detection.
* Identified top churn indicators such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
* Provided actionable insights that can help reduce churn rates.
